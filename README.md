# trading-futures-tradingview-script
I write pine script to trading futures ES1 NQ1 with signal IN (accurate 90%) and now I am trading on that
## Logic to trade futures
I can't use existing indicators to trade future, I lost so much
Few months ago, I backtest on this scripts and my idea is using the point to trade instead of indicator
Absolutely, the point is correct with futures.

For example, when "IN" signal notify I can CALL on Tradovate platform.
